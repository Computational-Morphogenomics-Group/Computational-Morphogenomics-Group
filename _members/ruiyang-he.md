<!-- Ruiyang completed his M.Sci in Systems Biology with the group with highest distinctions.
He is interested in single-cell technologies for investigating cellular processes at high resolution. His thesis explored 
multi-modal learning approaches combining gene expression, morphology and force inference in the context of mouse development. 
Outside of work, Ruiyang is a keen astronomer. Currently, Ruiyang is a Bioinformatics Analyst at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. -->

I am currently a first-year PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University. Prior to Columbia,
I completed a B.A. in Natural Sciences and M.Sci. in Systems Biology at the University of Cambridge. I am interested
in integrating advances in spatial transcriptomics technologies with novel computational and statistical methods to
dissect how spatial patterning arises in biological tissues and how spatial organization influences development and
disease.
