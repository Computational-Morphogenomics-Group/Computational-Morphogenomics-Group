I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Columbia University. Originally from Bucharest, Romania, I received my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics from Amherst College, where I worked with Prof. Lee Spector on genetic programming. My current interests include computational genomics, ML interpretability, data mining, and functional programming. Outside of work, I love exploring New York, playing guitar, and doing the Wordle religiously.
