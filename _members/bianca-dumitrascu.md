I am a junior PI and Departmental Early Career Fellow in the Computer Science Department at University of Cambridge. Previously, I was a Member in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study and I attended the semester long program in deep learning at the Statistical and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, where I was graciously hosted by David Dunson in the Duke Statistical Science Department. I received my PhD in Computational Biology at Princeton University, under the mentorship of Barbara E. Engelhardt. My PhD research focused on the effect of experimental design in single cell gene expression studies and on method development for structured, high-dimensional medical and genomic data. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at MIT. I am originally from Ramnicu Valcea, a small city in Romania.
