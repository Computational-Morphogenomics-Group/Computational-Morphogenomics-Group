I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics and a Herbert & Florence Irving Assistant Professor of Cancer Data Research at Columbia University. Previously, I was a Departmental Early Career Fellow in the Computer Science Department at University of Cambridge and a Member in the School of Mathematics at the Institute for Advanced Study. I received my PhD in Computational Biology at Princeton University, under the mentorship of Barbara E. Engelhardt. My PhD research focused on the effect of experimental design in single cell gene expression studies and on method development for structured, high-dimensional medical and genomic data. I did my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at MIT. I am originally from Ramnicu Valcea, a small city in Romania.
