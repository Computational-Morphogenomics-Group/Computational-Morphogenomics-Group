I am a first-year MS/PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia University. I received my Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering at Columbia, where I became interested in genomics and genomic data analysis by working in the Computational Cancer Biology, DNA Damage Repair, and Chemical Genomics labs. I am interested in cancer genomics, tissue regeneration, single-cell genetic perturbations, and the applications of machine learning in big genomic data to answer biological questions.
