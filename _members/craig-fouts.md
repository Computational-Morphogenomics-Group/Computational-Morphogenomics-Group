I am a first year Master's student studying Applied Mathematics at Columbia University. I received my Bachelor's in Computer Science and Theoretical Mathematics from The Ohio State University, where I began exploring collective behavior under Dr. Tanya Berger-Wolf as a member of the Computational Ecology, Environment, and Conservation Laboratory. Currently, my interests span the theory and applications of dynamical systems, computational genomics, and emergent artificial intelligence, all of which manifest in my ongoing research with self-organizing systems. I am also passionate about using these themes to showcase the artistic capabilities of differentiable programming.
