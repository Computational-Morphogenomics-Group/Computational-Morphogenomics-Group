I am a first year PhD student working on improving understanding of marine ecosystem dynamics. 
I am interested in the application of statistical machine learning techniques to this problem and how 
these can be optimally leveraged to uncover information about interactions between species. 
I am a member of the AI4ER CDT and my project is linked to the Cambridge University Computer Science 
department and British Antarctic Survey. Prior to joining the CDT I completed my undergraduate degree in Physics at Durham University. 
Outside of my work I enjoy playing Touch rugby both socially and competitively.
