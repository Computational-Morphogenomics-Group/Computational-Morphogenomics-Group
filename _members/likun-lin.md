I am a first-year Master's student majoring in statistics at Columbia University. I received my B.S.
in statistics at Central University of Finance and Economics, where I worked with Prof. Shan Lu on
statistical modeling for complex data. Fascinated by discovering biological insights through
computational and statistical methods, I am interested in computational genomics, focusing on
model interpretability. Beyond academics, I am a dedicated soccer enthusiast.
